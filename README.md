# Hello, I'm Nicholas! 
I'm currently a software developer student from Finland, eager to learn more and develop my skills.
I started uploading my code to github in April 2024, because I had gathered enough confidence
from websites like freecodecamp.

I am currently focusing on learning frontend and design applications like Figma and Adobe Illustrator. If you have any tips, don't hesitate to get in contact!

# Current skills
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- C#
- React & MUI Library
- Figma

# Currently learning
- Designing web pages and creating prototypes on Figma.
- Bringing these designs to life using React.
- Making these designs responsive using Material UI and figma.
